# scDEcrypter: to detect latent viral infection in scRNA-seq data
scDEcrypter is a statistical framework and R package designed to detect latent infection states in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data and perform robust differential expression (DE) analysis when cell-level labels are incomplete.

Additional details and a FAQ for SCnorm are described in the vignette: https://github.com/LZHONG25/scDEcrypter/blob/main/vignettes/scDEcrypter.pdf
