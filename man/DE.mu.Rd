\title{Estimate Mean Expression per Gene, Cell Type, and Condition}
\usage{
DE.mu(Y, W)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric matrix of dimension \eqn{(n \times p)}, where
\eqn{n} is the number of samples (cells) and \eqn{p} is the
number of features (genes).}

\item{W}{A numeric array of dimension \eqn{(n \times C \times V)},
where \eqn{C} is the number of cell types (or classes),
and \eqn{V} is the number of conditions (or contrasts).
Each slice \code{W[i,,]} contains the posterior weights for
sample \eqn{i}.}
}
\value{
A numeric array of dimension \eqn{(p \times C \times V)}
containing the weighted mean expression values.
Specifically, \code{M.out[j, c, v]} is the estimated mean of
gene \eqn{j} in cell type \eqn{c} under condition \eqn{v}.
}
\description{
Computes the weighted mean expression matrix across genes,
cell types, and conditions given observed data and posterior
weights.
