\title{Estimate Mean Expression per Gene, Cell Type, and Condition (DE)}
\usage{
DE_mu(Y, W, compStatus)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric matrix of dimension \eqn{(n \times p)}, where
\eqn{n} is the number of samples (cells) and \eqn{p} is the
number of features (genes).}

\item{W}{A numeric array of dimension \eqn{(n \times C \times V)},
where \eqn{C} is the number of cell types (or classes),
and \eqn{V} is the number of conditions (or contrasts).
Each slice \code{W[i,,]} contains the posterior weights for
sample \eqn{i}.}

\item{compStatus}{Integer or character vector specifying which
conditions should have separate mean estimates. Other conditions
will have their means estimated from the combined data.}
}
\value{
A numeric array of dimension \eqn{(p \times C \times V)}
containing the weighted mean expression values. \code{M.out[j, c, v]}
is the estimated mean of gene \eqn{j} in cell type \eqn{c} under
condition \eqn{v}.
}
\description{
Computes weighted mean expression matrices for the alternative hypothesis
in differential expression testing, where specified conditions show expression
differences while others share effects.
}
\details{
For conditions specified in \code{compStatus}, mean estimates are
computed separately using only samples from those conditions.
For other conditions, means are estimated as the average across all samples,
using mean weights to account for condition effects.
