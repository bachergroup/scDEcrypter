\title{Estimate Variance for Differential Expression Model}
\usage{
DE.sigma2(Y, W, M)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric matrix of dimension \eqn{(n \times p)}, where
\eqn{n} is the number of samples (cells) and \eqn{p} is the
number of features (genes).}

\item{W}{A numeric array of dimension \eqn{(n \times C \times V)},
where \eqn{C} is the number of cell types and \eqn{V} is the
number of conditions. Each slice \code{W[i,,]} contains the
posterior weights for sample \eqn{i}.}

\item{M}{A numeric array of dimension \eqn{(p \times C \times V)}
representing the estimated mean expression values.}
}
\value{
A numeric array of dimension \eqn{(p \times C \times V)},
where each entry \code{sigma2[j, c, v]} is the weighted variance
of gene \eqn{j} for cell type \eqn{c} under condition \eqn{v}.
}
\description{
Computes the weighted variance of gene expression across samples
for each gene, cell type, and condition, given posterior weights
and mean estimates.
