\title{Estimate Mixture Probabilities for Differential Expression Model}
\usage{
DE.probs(Y, W)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric matrix of dimension \eqn{(n \times p)}, where
\eqn{n} is the number of samples (cells) and \eqn{p} is the
number of features (genes). This argument is only used to
extract the number of samples \eqn{n}.}

\item{W}{A numeric array of dimension \eqn{(n \times C \times V)},
where \eqn{C} is the number of cell types and \eqn{V} is the
number of conditions. Each slice \code{W[i,,]} contains the
posterior weights for sample \eqn{i}.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of dimension \eqn{(C \times V)} containing
the estimated mixture probabilities. Each entry \code{probs[c, v]}
represents the average posterior probability of cell type \eqn{c}
under condition \eqn{v}.
}
\description{
Computes the estimated mixture probabilities (class/condition proportions)
by averaging posterior weights across all samples.
