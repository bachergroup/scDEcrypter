\title{Compute Approximate Complete Data Log-Likelihood}
\usage{
approx_complete_data_loglik(Y, M, W, sigma2, c_obs, v_obs)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numeric matrix of observed gene expression data with dimensions
(cells x genes), where rows represent cells and columns represent genes.}

\item{M}{Numeric 3-dimensional array of estimated mean parameters with dimensions
(genes x cell types x viral types), containing the mean gene expression
for each combination of gene, cell type, and viral type.}

\item{W}{Numeric 3-dimensional array of cell-type and viral-type weights with
dimensions (cells x cell types x viral types), representing the soft assignment
or responsibility of each cell to each cell type-viral type combination.}

\item{sigma2}{Numeric 3-dimensional array of estimated variance parameters with
dimensions (genes x cell types x viral types), containing the variance of gene
expression for each combination of gene, cell type, and viral type.}

\item{c_obs}{Integer vector of length matching the number of cells, giving the
observed cell type labels for each cell (may contain \code{NA}).}

\item{v_obs}{Integer vector of length matching the number of cells, giving the
observed viral type labels for each cell (may contain \code{NA}).}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with dimensions (genes x cell types) containing the
approximate log-likelihood contribution for each gene in each cell type,
aggregated across viral types and weighted by the assignment weights.
}
\description{
Computes the approximate complete data log-likelihood for differential expression
analysis under a mixture model framework. Calculates weighted log-likelihoods for
each gene-cell type combination, assuming normal distributions with observed
weights accounting for cell type-viral type assignments.
