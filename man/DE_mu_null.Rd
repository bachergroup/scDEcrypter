\title{Estimate Mean Expression Under Null Hypothesis (DE)}
\usage{
DE_mu_null(Y, W, compStatus)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric matrix of dimension \eqn{(n \times p)}, where
\eqn{n} is the number of samples (cells) and \eqn{p} is the
number of features (genes).}

\item{W}{A numeric array of dimension \eqn{(n \times C \times V)},
where \eqn{C} is the number of cell types (or classes),
and \eqn{V} is the number of conditions (or contrasts).}

\item{compStatus}{Integer or character vector specifying which
conditions are being compared. These conditions will share a
common mean estimate under the null hypothesis.}
}
\value{
A numeric array of dimension \eqn{(p \times C \times V)}
containing estimated mean expression values where means for
conditions in \code{compStatus} are identical, and other
conditions have separate estimates.
}
\description{
Computes weighted mean expression matrices for the null hypothesis
in differential expression testing, where specified conditions share
a common mean expression.
}
\details{
Under the null hypothesis, conditions in \code{compStatus} share the same
expression levels, so their means are estimated from combined data
to improve statistical power.
