\usage{
observed.data.loglik(Y, M, sigma2, probs, C.obs, V.obs)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numeric matrix of observed data with dimensions
\code{(n x p)}, where \code{n} is the number of samples (cells)
and \code{p} is the number of features (e.g., genes).}

\item{M}{Numeric array of mean estimates with dimensions
\code{(p x C x V)}, where \code{C} is the number of conditions
and \code{V} is the number of infection status}

\item{sigma2}{Numeric array of variance estimates with dimensions
\code{(p x C x V)}.}

\item{probs}{Numeric matrix of mixing proportions with dimensions
\code{(C x V)}.}

\item{C.obs}{Integer vector of length \code{n}, giving the observed
condition labels for each sample (use \code{NA} if unknown).}

\item{V.obs}{Integer vector of length \code{n}, giving the observed
variant labels for each sample (use \code{NA} if unknown).}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar: the observed-data log-likelihood value.
}
\description{
Computes the observed-data log-likelihood for the multiway mixture model,
given the observed data, mean estimates, variance estimates, mixing proportions,
and partially observed labels.
}
\details{
The function partitions samples based on whether their condition (\code{C.obs})
and variant (\code{V.obs}) labels are observed or missing:
\itemize{
\item Both known: exact log-likelihood contribution.
\item Condition unknown: marginalizes over all conditions.
\item Variant unknown: marginalizes over all variants.
\item Both unknown: marginalizes over both dimensions.
