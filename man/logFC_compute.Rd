\title{Compute Log-Fold Changes Between Conditions}
\usage{
logFC_compute(M, Condition = NULL, V.levels = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{A numeric array of dimension \eqn{(p \times C \times V)},
where \eqn{p} is the number of genes, \eqn{C} is the number of
cell types, and \eqn{V} is the number of conditions. Entries
represent estimated mean expression levels.}

\item{Condition}{Optional character vector of length \eqn{C},
specifying names of cell types. If \code{NULL}, generic labels
\code{"celltype1"}, \code{"celltype2"}, … are used in the output.}

\item{V.levels}{Optional character vector of length \eqn{V},
specifying names of conditions. If \code{NULL}, defaults to
\code{"V1"}, \code{"V2"}, ….}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames, one for each condition contrast
(e.g., \code{"V1_vs_V2"}). Each data frame has \eqn{p} rows
(genes) and \eqn{C} columns (cell types), where each entry is the
log-fold change between the two conditions:
\deqn{ \text{logFC}_{j,c} = M_{j,c,v1} - M_{j,c,v2} }
}
\description{
Computes log-fold change (logFC) contrasts between all pairs of
conditions/contrasts for each gene and cell type, given estimated
mean expression values.
