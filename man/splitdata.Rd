\title{Split Data into Training and Test Sets by Variant}
\usage{
splitdata(Y, C.obs, V.obs, seed, train_frac = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numeric matrix of observed data with dimensions
\code{(n x p)}, where \code{n} is the number of samples (cells)
and \code{p} is the number of features (e.g., genes).}

\item{C.obs}{Integer vector of length \code{n}, giving the observed
condition labels for each sample (may contain \code{NA}).}

\item{V.obs}{Integer vector of length \code{n}, giving the observed
infection status labels for each sample (may contain \code{NA}).}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility.}

\item{train_frac}{Numeric in \code{(0,1)}. Proportion of samples
within each variant (and missing group) assigned to the training
set. Defaults to \code{0.5}.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{Y_generation}}{Training subset of \code{Y}.}
\item{\code{C.obs_generation}}{Training subset of \code{C.obs}.}
\item{\code{V.obs_generation}}{Training subset of \code{V.obs}.}
\item{\code{Y_test}}{Test subset of \code{Y}.}
\item{\code{C.obs_test}}{Test subset of \code{C.obs}.}
\item{\code{V.obs_test}}{Test subset of \code{V.obs}.}
\item{\code{generation_idx}}{Row indices assigned to training.}
\item{\code{test_idx}}{Row indices assigned to test.}
}

\description{
Splits the observed dataset into training ("generation") and test
subsets, stratified by variant labels. Samples with missing variant
labels are also split proportionally.
